# Stock Search Integration - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

Successfully integrated **real-time stock search** using the Finnhub API. Users can now search for any publicly traded stock and purchase it for their children's portfolios.

## 🔍 How It Works

### 1. **Search Flow**

When a user types in the investment search box:

1. **Frontend** sends search query to `/api/investments/search?q=apple`
2. **Backend** calls Finnhub's search API to find matching stocks
3. For each result, we:
   - Check if the stock already exists in our database
   - If not, fetch real-time quote data from Finnhub
   - Create a temporary investment object with real-time price
   - Return it to the frontend for display

### 2. **Purchase Flow**

When a user selects a searched stock to gift:

1. Frontend sends the investment ID (e.g., `temp-AAPL`)
2. Backend detects the temporary ID and:
   - Extracts the stock symbol
   - Fetches company profile and latest quote from Finnhub
   - Creates the investment in the database
   - Proceeds with gift creation using the real database ID

### 3. **Logo Display**

- Stocks are automatically mapped to company domains (200+ mappings)
- Clearbit fetches the company logo
- Fallback to colored tiles for unmapped stocks

## 🎯 Key Features

### Real-Time Search
```typescript
// Example search query
GET /api/investments/search?q=tesla

// Returns:
[
  {
    id: "temp-TSLA",
    symbol: "TSLA",
    name: "Tesla Inc",
    type: "stock",
    currentPrice: "241.50",
    ytdReturn: "2.22"
  }
]
```

### Automatic Database Population
- Stocks are only added to the database when actually purchased
- Prevents database bloat from searches
- Real-time pricing on every search

### Smart Type Detection
The system automatically determines if a security is:
- **Stock**: Individual company shares
- **ETF**: Detected by symbol pattern (SPY, VOO, QQQ, XL*, etc.)
- **Crypto**: Detected by symbol (BTC, ETH, DOGE, etc.)

## 🔐 API Usage

### Finnhub API Calls

Each search query makes:
1. **1 search API call** (returns up to 10 results)
2. **N quote API calls** (one per search result shown)

**Example**: Searching "apple" might use 2-3 API calls total

### Rate Limits
- Free tier: 60 calls/minute
- Typical search: 3-5 calls
- Can handle ~12-20 searches per minute
- More than enough for normal usage

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Required Environment Variable
```env
FINNHUB_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Optional (but recommended)
Add more ticker mappings to `client/src/lib/stock-logo.ts` for better logo coverage.

## 🧪 Testing

### Try These Searches
- **By symbol**: "AAPL", "TSLA", "GOOGL"
- **By name**: "apple", "tesla", "microsoft"
- **Partial match**: "tech", "bank", "energy"
- **ETFs**: "spy", "voo", "qqq"

### Expected Behavior
1. Results appear as you type (minimum 3 characters)
